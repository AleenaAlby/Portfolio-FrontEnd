                    My name is Aleena Alby, and I am based in England, UK. In January 2022,
                    I graduated with distinction from Coventry University, where I earned my MSc in Data Science and Computational Intelligence. Currently,
                    I am actively attending interviews and facing rejections ðŸ˜…. However, these setbacks only serve to encourage me and remind me that failure is a stepping stone to success ðŸ’ª.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As I continue to navigate the world and learn how to live in it, I have discovered my passion and talent for web development.
                    I have honed my skills in React JS, Python Django, and JavaScript, which have allowed me to create engaging and dynamic websites.
                    Additionally, I am fascinated by machine learning and its potential applications in various industries.
                    <br/><br/>
                    On a personal level, I possess a unique blend of introverted and extroverted qualities.  deeply value honesty, integrity, and kindness.
                    I am a strong advocate for sustainability and environmental responsibility. I believe that we all have a role to play in preserving our planet for future generations.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Aside from my professional interests, I am a firm believer in the importance of lifelong learning and self-improvement. I am always eager to explore new technologies, embrace new challenges, and collaborate with like-minded individuals.
                    In my spare time, you can find me experimenting with new coding techniques or participating in online coding communities to broaden my horizons and sharpen my skills.
